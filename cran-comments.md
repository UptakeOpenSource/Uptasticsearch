# CRAN Submission History

## v0.0.2 - Submission 1 - (July 17, 2017)

### Test environments
* Alpine 3.5 (on Jenkins CI), R 3.4.0
* local CentOS 7.3, R 3.4.0
* local OS X, R 3.3.2
* local Windows 10, R 3.3.2
* Windows via `devtools::build_win()`

### R CMD check results
* There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.  
* One NOTE from `checking CRAN incoming feasibility ...` can be safely ignored since it's a note that notifies CRAN that this is a new maintainer/submission. 

### CRAN Response
* Automatic checking upon CRAN submission yielded two notes. One was the "incoming feasbility..." item we mentioned above, which is not an issue. 
* The other note said that `Author field differs from that derived from Authors@R`. This did not arise when running `R CMD check --as-cran` locally, but it looks like "fnd" is not a supported tag for an author. Removed that tag.
